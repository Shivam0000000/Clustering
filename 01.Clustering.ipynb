    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most common clustering algorithms and their differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Clustering:\n",
    "- Approach: K-Means aims to partition data into K clusters, where each cluster is represented by its center (centroid). It iteratively\n",
    "           assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroids until convergence.\n",
    "- Assumptions: Assumes clusters are spherical and of roughly equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "- Approach: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or splitting existing clusters. It can be represented as a \n",
    "            tree-like structure called a dendrogram.\n",
    "- Assumptions: No specific assumptions about cluster shapes; it's agnostic to the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "- Approach: It groups data points based on their density, considering data points in dense regions as clusters and those in sparse\n",
    "           regions as noise.\n",
    "- Assumptions: Assumes clusters can have arbitrary shapes and sizes, and it does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean-Shift Clustering:\n",
    "- Approach: Similar to K-Means, it iteratively shifts cluster centers to areas of higher data point density. Clusters are located at the \n",
    "            convergence points of the density estimate.\n",
    "- Assumptions: No specific assumptions about cluster shapes; it can identify clusters with varying shapes and sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):\n",
    "- Approach: Models data points as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. It estimates the parameters of these distributions to find\n",

    "- Assumptions: Assumes that data points within each cluster are generated from a Gaussian distribution. Can identify clusters with different\n",
    "               shapes and sizes.\n",

    "Agglomerative Clustering:\n",
    "- Approach: Starts with each data point as its cluster and iteratively merges the closest clusters based on a distance metric \n",
    "            (e.g., Euclidean distance).\n",
    "- Assumptions: No specific assumptions about cluster shapes; it's agnostic to the number of clusters.\n",

    "Spectral Clustering:\n",
    "- Approach: Utilizes the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix to transform the data into a lower-dimensional space. Clustering is performed\n",

    "- Assumptions: No specific assumptions about cluster shapes; can handle non-convex clusters.\n",
